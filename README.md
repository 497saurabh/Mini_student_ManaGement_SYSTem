# Student and Instructor Information System

## Introduction

Frontend is developed useing React JS and in the backend, we have handled the CPU intensive operations using Spring Boot and we have used Node JS to handle I/O intensive operations. 
By using the admin panel of this system, an admin can Add/Delete Courses, Add/Delete Faculties, Add/Delete Admins, Add/Delete Instructors.

Students can register to the system. After registration a student can log in to the system using email and password. Instructors and Admin can also login to the system using the same login by inputting the email and password provided by the main admin.

Once main admin creates Instructors and Admin the created admin and instructors will receive a confirmation email and for students also once they are registered, they will receive a verification email to activate their account.

Instructors can add course and create assignment materials to the system and then student can view the courses and upload files to the created assignments.

All the Admin/Instructors/Students cans search courses by providing course name or course id.
